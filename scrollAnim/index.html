	 <div id="first-text" class="text-section">
		<p class="text">Vincent Van Gogh wakes up early in the morning, as the sun's bright rays peek through his window. He wakes up in his bedroom as depicted in "Bedroom in Arles", and gets up to get dressed and ready for the day. He has a relaxed day planned ahead, with walks and indulging in his passion of painting.</p>

	 <div id="second-text" class="text-section">
		<p class="text">After getting ready for the day, he takes a look out of his window to take in the beautiful view from his room. This view is so breathtaking that it has inspired him to paint his "Wheat Field with Cypresses". He takes more inspiration from this view to have a good day ahead.</p>
	</div>

	 <div id="view" class="painting"></div>

	 <div id="third-text" class="text-section">
		<p class="text">Vincent decides to start his outing by visiting the countryside for a peaceful walk. During his walk he walks by farmlands and sees a family. He witnesses the joyous milestone of the child taking his first steps, as depicted in his "First Steps, after Millet" What a happy moment he walked by! His mood is lifted by this encounter - he will have a good day.</p>

	 <div id="fourth-text" class="text-section">
		<p class="text">As the day progresses, the sky begins to darken, and a storm approaches. He has been walking so long he made it to the city! Vincent quickly sets up his easel and starts painting "Starry Night," capturing the turbulent sky, the swirling stars, and the peaceful village below. He tries to capture the energy and emotion of the moment, the power of nature and its impact on human experience.</p>

	 <div id="fifth-text" class="text-section">
		<p class="text">Finally, as the day comes to a close, Vincent paints "Café Terrace at Night," capturing the ambiance of a typical night in Arles. The warm glow of the café lights, the hustle and bustle of the people, the sense of community and connection. Vincent realizes that these simple moments are what make life worth living, and he wants to capture them in his paintings.</p>

	 <div id="sixth-text" class="text-section">
		<p class="text">And with that, Vincent ends his day, his heart and soul poured out onto the canvas, his art capturing the beauty and complexity of life.</p>

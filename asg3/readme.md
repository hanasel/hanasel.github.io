<h1> Ahlan Ramadan </h1>

<h3> Project Name: Ahlan Ramadan </h3>

<h4> Created by: Hana Selmani, Majid Ibrahim, Mira Saleh, Aiya Sartbayeva </h4>

<h3> Project Description </h3>

Our project is dedicated to capturing the essence of iftar, the evening meal during the holy month of Ramadan when Muslims break their fast. The overall concept and theme of the website revolve around creating an immersive experience through an audio piece that illustrates the ambience, emotions, and traditions of Iftar during Ramadan.

We were striving to create a captivating experience that would guide users through a sensory journey, encompassing the diverse sounds linked with iftar, from the preparations of cooking and setting the table, to the doorbell ringing and the welcoming of guests, to the sounds of a large family dinner and the anticipation of watching a Ramadan TV show, and finally to the Taraweeh prayer at the mosque. 

During the brainstorming of a storyline for our sound piece, we considered different themes related to everyday life, such as nature sounds, cityscapes, cultural celebrations, and more. However, after careful deliberation and considering the significance of iftar during Ramadan, we collectively agreed that it would be a meaningful and relevant topic to focus on for the SOUNDS LIKE assignment. 

Cultural Significance
we chose to dedicate the project to Iftar because of its deep cultural significance for Muslims. Ramadan is a special month in the Islamic calendar, and iftar holds a special place in the hearts and minds of Muslims around the world. By focusing on Iftar, we wanted to create a website that would authentically capture the sounds and experiences associated with this cherished moment.

Emotional Connection
we recognized that the various sounds of iftar, such as the sizzling of food being cooked, the laughter of family and friends, and the call to prayer, evoke strong emotions and memories for Muslims. We wanted to create a website that would allow users to emotionally connect with the sounds of Iftar, triggering nostalgia, anticipation, and joy.

Storytelling Opportunity
we saw an opportunity to tell a unique story through the timeline of iftar. By designing the website to follow the progression of iftar, from the preparations to the final prayers, we aimed to create a cohesive and engaging narrative that would draw users into the experience and immerse them in the different aspects of iftar.

Inclusivity
we recognized that Ramadan and iftar are not only limited to Muslims but also hold cultural significance for people from diverse backgrounds and faiths. By dedicating the project to iftar, we aimed to create a website that would be inclusive and provide an opportunity for people of different cultures and faiths to learn and appreciate the traditions and sounds associated with iftar during Ramadan.

<h3> Process: How did you go about implementing the concept </h3>

Our very first step was to craft a narrative arc, the storyline that follows the timeline of Iftar.  We made a narrative structure which provides a cohesive and engaging storyline that guides the users through the different stages of iftar. It looked like this:

cooking
setting the table
doorbell ringing
“assalamu alaikum, please come in”
lots of sounds (big/extended family dinner)
“I’m hungry”
everyone sits at the table
ramadan cannon (shot)
adhan sound
dua (record it). 
Translation: “Oh Allah! I fasted for you, and I believe in you, and I put my trust in you, and I break my fast with Your sustenance. Thirst is gone, the veins are moistened, and the reward is certain if Allah wills. By the name of God”
pouring and gulping water 
eating 
large group of people ambience
“Turn on the TV the shows about to start”
play ramadan TV show
raraweeh prayer: 
rushing to the mosque (loud running sounds)
adhan 
group praying (when they say Ameen) 
footsteps sounds walking back home
“Is it on?”
“It’s about to start”
Turning TV on
Ramadan TV theme song 

Then, the most important and, in our opinion, challenging part of this assignment was to find authentic audio recordings from the internet. We researched and gathered various audio elements that are associated with iftar, such as cooking sounds, doorbell sound effects, family dinner ambience, adhan, Taraweeh prayer recitation, TV show theme songs, and more. In most cases, we converted the videos (mp4) to audio format (mp3). We made sure to use authentic and high-quality recordings to create a realistic and immersive experience for the users. To add a personal touch and authenticity to the audio experience, we recorded Majid’s voice, such as reading duaa (prayers) while breaking the fast, as well as some speech. 

To achieve the enhanced final result, we used Audacity. The use of this software allowed us to create a layer of customization. Specifically:

(normalization) we used it feature to adjust the volume levels of the sounds to ensure that they were consistent and balanced. This helped us to prevent any abrupt changes in volume that could potentially disrupt the user's experience and create a smooth listening experience.

(fade in/fade out) we applied this effect to some of the sounds to create a gradual transition between different sounds or to soften the abrupt endings or beginnings of sounds. It provided a smoother and more immersive flow to the audio.

(trimming and editing) we used these editing features to remove any unwanted sections or noise from the sounds, ensuring that they were clean and focused. 

(equalization) we used it to adjust the frequencies of the sounds, optimizing their tonal balance and ensuring that they sounded clear and pleasant to our ears. It helped to enhance the overall quality and richness of the sounds, making them more engaging.

Next step was to create a webpage using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. We focused on creating a user-friendly design that prioritized ease of use and intuitive navigation. To align the design with the tone and content of the audio, we incorporated pictures that were generated by AI. These AI-generated pictures were carefully selected to enhance the visual elements and add an additional layer of immersion to the user experience. We decided to use JavaScript to create a slideshow, where each image would help the audience feel more immersed in the environment. Each image was individually timed to be perfectly synced with the audio. We have a user-friendly interface with intuitive navigation, visually appealing pictures that capture the theme and tone of Ramadan, and translations for the dua and adhan to promote inclusivity.

<h3> Reflection/Evaluation </h3>

To sum everything up, we believe that the final result met the initial expectations and goals that were set during our concept development phase.

The overall concept and theme of the website, which aims to provide an immersive audio experience of iftar, has been effectively implemented through the selection of appropriate audio elements, crafting of a cohesive storyline, and designing a user-friendly web interface. The audio elements, including cooking sounds, doorbell sounds, family dinner ambiance, adhan, dua, gulping water, eating sounds, Taraweeh prayer sounds, and TV show theme song, were carefully curated to capture the different aspects of iftar and create a realistic and immersive soundscape. The web design is aligned with the tone and content of this audio, creating an aesthetic that reflects the theme and mood of Ramadan.

It is worth mentioning that inclusivity was also considered in our project by providing translations of the dua and adhan to promote understanding and cultural sensitivity for users who may not be familiar with Islamic traditions or the Arabic language. We believe we created a unique and engaging audio experience for users to explore and enjoy the sounds of iftar during the holy month of Ramadan.
